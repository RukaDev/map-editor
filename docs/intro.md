# DejaVu Editor

DejaVu is a template based approach to map/level design that allows for large, customizeable worlds without the extra work that comes with an expansive map. This is achieved through the creation of templates that can be seamlessly mix and matched to create the illusion of
unique sections of the map.

## Why Dejavu?

### Reduce the amount of work
* Don't have to design as many components
* Can reuse or set minor adjustments to common areas

### Lower memory
* Removes the need to store properties for every object
* Template based design promotes reusablility

### Maintain flexibility and control
* Lets the user define modular objects
* Allows for non-template portions as well
