# Next Steps

## Using Your Map

If you'd like to use your map as is, you're fine to do so. However, since Dejavu editor is geared toward creating large, expansive maps, it's not ideal to have such a large map all loaded in at once. To combat this, you can use [Cyclone](https://github.com/rukadev/cyclone), a module I created to dynamically load your Dejavu-genrated map with performance considerations in mind.

## Future Features

* Handling assets that collide (by using a priority to set which layouts overrule others).
* Adjust height of asset based on the ground.
* Ability to freely place non-template based assets.
* Undo option for loading/saving.
* Ability to store different variations of the same map.
