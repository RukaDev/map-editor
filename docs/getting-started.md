# Getting Started

## Installation
To install, download the latest `rbxm` release of `Dejavu` from the [releases](https://github.com/rukadev/dejavu/releases) page.

---

## Setup

Before Dejavu is ready for use, it will require a few extra steps.

Within the `Dejavu` module, there are folders whose name corresponds to where their children should be placed in the explorer.

Once setup, your **Workspace** should contain the folders "Layouts" and "Map", and **Replicated Storage** should have "Dejavu".

:::tip
It's recommended that you create a new world to use for your map creation.

## Command Bar
Dejavu processes are run through the command bar. To set this up for easier access, reference Dejavu in the command bar as a variable like so:

```js
Dejavu = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Dejavu)
```

That concludes the setup and installation, next we'll learn about [Layouts](./layouts.md)
